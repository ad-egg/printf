# printf 
## man_3_printf
This is the manual page for our `_printf` function.
## holberton.h
This header file contains the prototypes for all the functions used.
## `*.c`
- All of the `.c` files along with a `main.c` file are to be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with the flags `-Wall` `Werror` `-Westra` and `-pedantic`.
- Each file ends with a new line and contains no more than 5 functions.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- All files use the `Betty` style and were checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl).
- The executable compiled from all of the `.c` files prints to standard output the formatted arguments that were passed to the `_printf` function.
- Authorized functions and macros for this project are:
	- `write (man 2 write)`
	- `malloc (man 3 malloc)`
	- `free (man 3 free)`
	- `va_start (man 3 va_start)`
	- `va_end (man 3 va_end)`
	- `va_copy (man 3 va_copy)`
