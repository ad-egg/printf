# printf 
## man_3_printf
This is the manual page for our `_printf` function.
## holberton.h
This header file contains the prototypes for all the functions used.
## `*.c`
All of the `.c` files along with a `main.c` file are to be compiled with the command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c` on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Each file ends with a new line and contains no more than 5 functions. The executable compiled from all of the `.c` files prints to standard output the formatted arguments that were passed to the `_printf` function. Authorized functions and macros for this project are:
- `write (man 2 write)`
- `malloc (man 3 malloc)`
- `free (man 3 free)`
- `va_start (man 3 va_start)`
- `va_end (man 3 va_end)`
- `va_copy (man 3 va_copy)`
- `va_arg (man 3 va_arg)`
