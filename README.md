# printf 
## man_3_printf
This is the manual page for our `_printf` function.
## holberton.h
This header file contains the prototypes for all the functions used.
## `*.c`
All of the `.c` files along with a `main.c` file are to be compiled with the command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c`. The executable compiled from all of the `.c` files prints to standard output the formatted arguments that were passed to the `_printf` function.
